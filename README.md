Petition Pinger
---------------

I noticed that the Parliamentary petition website [publishes petition data as JSON](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/171928.json)

So thought I'd have a go at flashing the constituencies as votes are added

Many thanks to [timcraft and his election map - which is awesome](https://github.com/timcraft/electionmap)
